Often time we get distracted by the social media & OTT platform, using this cli tool we can restrict access to site.
This tool just points passed website to 127.0.0.1
For example: 
On running "site-blocker example.com" command
Create below entry it the /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 example.com www.example.com`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
